                        Java. The city of Gresik is located between the city of Surabaya and the city of Lamongan.
                        Gresik city itself is the only city in Indonesia that has many names. Some of its nicknames
                        are
                        Pudak City, Milkfish City, Industry City and guardian or santri City.</p>

                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">Gresik is called Pudak City because Pudak is a typical
                        food of Gresik city. This food is made from rice flour, sugar and coconut milk wrapped in Ope
                        (betel nut (Pelepah Pinang)), then steamed. The people of Gresik city themselves usually use
                        Pudak as snacks to
                        treat various kinds of celebrations. Starting from wedding celebrations, circumcision,
                        celebration of a new house, to death, Pudak is also used as a treat, besides that, tourists also
                        make pudak as one of the typical souvenirs of the city of Gresik. Pudak Gresik has a distinctive
                        taste compared to other foods. Pudak taste also varies; there is white pudak because it is
                        without coloring and only uses granulated sugar, there is red pudak also without coloring
                        ingredients using only brown sugar, there is sago pudak made from sago, and there is also green
                        pandan pudak with original coloring from pandan leaves so that it smells typical pandan .</p>
                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">
                        Besides the distinctive taste, the pudak wrapped in Ope has a distinctive shape as well. No
                        other type of food is the same as the Pudak form. This is because Ope itself has begun to obtain
                        steps and its manufacture is not simple. Ope derived from areca nut cannot be directly used as a
                        Pudak wrapper. Ope must first be processed through various stages; starting from the betel nut
                        which is cleaned, then cut into squares according to size, then folded in half and sewn on the
                        other two sides until the Ope becomes a ready-to-use wrap.

                        including Sunan Giri and Sunan Maulana Malik Ibrahim. No wonder many people refer to Gresik as
                        the city of guardians or the city of santri because of the existence of a guardian and identical
                        with the spread of Islam in depth. Sunan Giri's Pesareans are located at the top of Mount Giri,
                        the only mountain in the city of Gresik. There is a statement that says that all buildings in
                        the city of Gresik must not exceed the height of Mount Giri, where Sunan Giri's market is
                        located. If there is a building that is higher than Sunan Giri's market place, the building will
                        collapse or will not last long. I don't know if this is true or just a myth, but strangely,
                        there is not a single skyscraper in Gresik, unlike other big cities in general.</p>
                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">
                        In addition, the gate of Sunan Giri's market place has become the pride icon of the city of
                        Gresik. It is proven that when we just entered the Gresik city area from Surabaya, we will be
                        treated to a replica of the typical Sunan Giri gate as a sign that we have entered the entrance
                        gate of the Gresik city area. And then we will also be treated to the giant slogans of the city
                        of Gresik which are lined up along Veteran Street such as; "Gresik City of Faith" and "Gresik
                        Decorated with Faith".

                        will never finish in one face-to-face because there are so many traditions that continue to be
                        cultivated among the people of the city of Gresik. For example, at the end of the month of
                        Ramadan, the traditional milkfish auction and malem selawe3 are held. Milkfish auction, one of
                        the annual traditions that has never been abandoned by the people of Gresik. Every year at the
                        end of the fasting month, the month of Ramadan, to be precise on the 28th of Ramadan night, or
                        commonly known as Malem songolikur4, there is always an auction of milkfish. The auction, which
                        is usually held along the Kota market street, aims to cultivate milkfish which is a typical fish
                        of the city of Gresik as well as a prestigious event for milkfish lovers as a mandatory food
                        during Eid.</p>
                    <p class="lead" style="text-align: justify;">
                        In the auction, there were a lot of farmers in the city of Gresik who deliberately took care of
                        their milkfish until they were large and worthy of being included in the auction. It is a matter
                        of pride for the fishpond that their milkfish is the winner as the largest milkfish out of all
                        the milkfish that have been put up for auction. The bigger and longer the milkfish, the more
                        expensive it will be. One milkfish that weighs more than 5 kg with a length of more than one
                        meter can reach a price of Rp. 5,000,000, -. Selewe night is an annual tradition of the people
                        around the Sunan Giri area. This Selawe night activity is a kind of large-scale bazaar event
                        which is held along the road to Sunan Giri's tomb. Starting from the Kebomas intersection to the
                        Sekarkurung T-junction, all roads were blocked from the afternoon of the 24th of Ramadan, until
                        the dawn of the 25th of Ramadan to be used as a place to hold the Selawe Night event.
